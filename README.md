# template
C++ template for debugging and more...
This C++ template is designed for people who wants to do competitive programming and in this you can easily debug and check your code to see it's working.
The syntax used in this template are simple and easy to use.
I haven't added and shortcuts for loops and input formatting, as they are basic and and are known by most people (you can still add your own shortcuts to it).
